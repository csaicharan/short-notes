    Takeaways Always wont required unless you have complex state maitainence and multiple sources of changing data like sockets, firebase and user interactions.

    Iron Clad Reason to Use ngrx/store
        You have race conditions as a result of multiple actors (ie, user, websockets and/or workers) interacting with the application state

    Possible Reasons to Use ngrx/store
        State management is complex
        Component interactions are excessive
        Multiple state manipulators are at work (ie, server-push)
        Understanding state and its behavior is becoming difficult
        Snapshotting of the state is important
        “Undo” support is required
